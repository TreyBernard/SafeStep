Hello, world! This is currently the beta for the Safe Step app hopefully to be fully launched to the app store soon. 
It is an AI based program that uses OpenCV and Yolov8 to detect objects in the real live world that may appear when 
someone is crossing the street, it was designed to assist visually impaired individuals with a daily problem they may face

Currently this repository does not include the datasets, node_modules, and the virtual environment unfortunately due to 
the sheer size of those files, however if you do wish to see them please send one of us a message via discord: pohzz, thejoshperez, briansprs
